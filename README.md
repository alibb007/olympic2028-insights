## 🎯 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the impact of hosting the Olympics on a country's performance and predict the possible outcomes of the 2028 Olympics. We'll use historical Olympic data and economic indicators to draw insights and present them in an interactive Streamlit app.

## 🚀 Project Goals
1. **Analyze**: How hosting the Olympics affects a country’s medal count and economic indicators.
2. **Predict**: Medal outcomes for the 2028 Olympics using machine learning models.
3. **Visualize**: Present findings and predictions through an interactive Streamlit app.

## 🌟 Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore how hosting the Olympics has impacted different countries over time.
- **2028 Predictions**: See predictions for the 2028 Olympics based on historical data.
- **Economic Impact**: Analyze the economic indicators related to hosting the Olympics.

## 📊 Datasets

1. **Olympic Games Dataset**:
   - [120 Years of Olympic History Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)
   - Contains data on athletes, events, and results from the modern Olympic Games.

2. **Economic Data**:
   - [World Bank Data](https://data.worldbank.org/)
   - Economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, etc., for various countries.

## 📈 Predicting the 2028 Olympics
Using historical data and machine learning models, we aim to predict the medal counts for countries in the 2028 Olympics. This involves:
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and processing historical Olympic data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Identifying key features that impact a country’s performance.
- **Modeling**: Training machine learning models to predict medal outcomes.
- **Validation**: Testing the models on recent Olympic data.
- **Prediction**: Making predictions for 2028 based on the trained models.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Download the Datasets

- **Olympic Games Dataset**: Download and move to `data/olympic_history.csv`.
- **World Bank Data**: Download relevant economic data and move to `data/economic_data.csv`.

### 2. Set Up the Project Environment

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
    ```
2. Install Required Packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Set Up a Basic Streamlit App**:
   - Create `app.py`:
   ```python
   import streamlit as st

   st.title("🏅 Olympic Analysis Project")
   st.write("Analyze the impact of hosting the Olympics and predict 2028 medal outcomes.")
   ```
   Run the Streamlit App:
   
5. **Run the Streamlit App**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
## 🧠 Next Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: Use Jupyter notebooks to explore the Olympic history and economic data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Prepare the datasets for analysis and modeling.
3. **Modeling**: Develop models to predict 2028 Olympic outcomes.
4. **Visualization**: Create interactive visualizations and deploy them in the Streamlit app.
